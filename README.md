# Project-Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Context
The need to minimize credit card fraud is the motivation for the project. We employed the simple Logistic regression algorithm to detect whether a transaction in legit or fraudulent. The project is part of Kaggle projects and it's entirely menat for machine learning modeling practice in this case.

Content
The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders.
This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account 492 transactions while legits accounts for 284315 transactions.

We have 28 features represents as principal components using PCA.

To evaluate the model, we used the simple accuracy score acheiveing a training accuracy of 91% and a test accuracy of 90%.
